# colorls dotfiles

These are my [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls) dotfiles.
They're pretty great.

## Installation

Download and copy everything in `home` to your home directory, or use
[homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) and save
yourself the trouble:

    $ homesick clone jgorset/colorls-dotfiles
    $ homesick symlink colorls-dotfiles

That's it! You're all done.
